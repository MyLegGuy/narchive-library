narchive but it's a library.
fork of https://github.com/nickworonekin/narchive

see test.cs for example usage.

02/15/21:
the create narc function now uses a new class called CopyOnlyStream
(there is still a version of the function that takes streams as input though)
CopyOnlyStream is a class that can get the length of or copy its data to a Stream. that's it.
in the test code, you can find an example of a CopyOnlyStream for a file input.
it only opens the file on demand, so you can create tons of CopyOnlyStream without having all the files open at once.
this allows you to make huge narcs.
